Â Functional enrichment analysis of these genes was performed using the DAVID bioinformatics tool (Sherman et al., 2022). 
After that, Gene Ontology (GO) terms and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were analyzed 
to gain insights into the biological implications of gene expression changes.
