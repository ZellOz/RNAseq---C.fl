# RNAseq Analaysis for CamponotusFloridanus(Host) & Blochmmania(Endosymbiont)
This study was performed to find the candidate genes that drive the embryonic novelty in the germ-line transmission of carpenter ants. Since the genus has the endosymbiotic bacteria, the interaction between two organisms affects the development and reproduction of the host. Both genomes were examined via transcriptomic analysis.
