# RNAseq Analaysis for CamponotusFloridanus(Host) & Blochmmania(Endosymbiont)
This study aimed to identify candidate genes underlying the evolutionary novelty associated with germ-line transmission in carpenter ants. Given that this tribe harbors endosymbiotic bacteria, host development and reproduction are influenced by host–symbiont interactions. To investigate these dynamics, we performed transcriptomic analyses of both genomes.
